#evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False
#When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:

print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)


a = 2000
b = 3034

if a >= b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else:
    print("b is greater than a")
